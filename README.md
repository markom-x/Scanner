# Biomedical Data Analysis

This project contains a simple Python script to analyze and visualize biomedical data.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the analysis script:

```bash
python biomed/analyze.py
```

The script loads sample data from `biomed/data/ucl_samples.csv`, downloaded from a
UCL repository. It prints summary statistics and displays a scatter plot of the
two features contained in the dataset.
